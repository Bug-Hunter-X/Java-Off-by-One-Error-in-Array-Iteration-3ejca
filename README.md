This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Java array iteration that results in an IndexOutOfBoundsException. The `Bug.java` file contains the erroneous code, while `BugSolution.java` provides the corrected version.  The error arises from using `i <= arr.length` in the for loop instead of `i < arr.length`. Array indices start at 0, so accessing arr[arr.length] throws an exception. The solution fixes this by changing the loop condition to correctly iterate up to, but not including, the length of the array.
